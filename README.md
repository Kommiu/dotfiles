# dotfiles
Here I try to adapt various public dotfiles to my needs using [toml-bombadil dotfile manager by @oknozor](https://github.com/oknozor/toml-bombadil) and learn about ricing.
##### Themes: 
* My old dotfiles mostly based on [dotfiles from @eayu](https://github.com/eayus/dotfiles)
* [monochrome theme by @Juicyexe](https://github.com/Juicyexe/arch-monochrome/)
